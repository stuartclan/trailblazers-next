Design System Improvements:
- Consistent color palette and spacing
- Standardized component props and interfaces
- Reusable loading and error states
- Unified animation and transition timing
- Consistent icon usage and sizing

Known Issues to Address:
✅ FIXED: Inconsistent loading states across pages
✅ FIXED: Poor error handling and user feedback
✅ FIXED: Missing navigation context (breadcrumbs)
✅ FIXED: Basic mobile responsive issues
- Some forms could still use better mobile layouts
- Toast notification system not yet implemented
- Keyboard navigation could be improved
- Some pages still need the new loading/error components

Technical Debt:
- Consider implementing a global state management solution for complex flows
- Some API error handling could be more granular
- Component prop interfaces could be more standardized
- Consider adding storybook for component documentation
- Add proper TypeScript strict mode configuration

Performance Considerations:
- Implement proper code splitting for large components
- Add React.memo for expensive components
- Optimize image loading and caching
- Consider implementing virtual scrolling for large lists
- Add proper loading states to prevent layout shift

Accessibility Improvements Made:
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Focus management in modals and forms
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly error messages
- Color contrast compliance
- Touch target sizing for mobile

Code Quality Standards:
- ESLint configuration enforced
- TypeScript strict mode (partially implemented)
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper component documentation
- Error boundary implementation
- Proper prop typing and interfaces

Security Considerations:
- Input validation on both client and server
- Proper authentication token handling
- XSS prevention in form inputs
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Secure handling of sensitive data (emergency contacts)

Testing Strategy (Future):
- Unit tests for utility functions and hooks
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Accessibility testing with axe-core
- Performance testing for slow networks

Deployment Considerations (Future):
- Environment-specific configurations
- Database migration scripts
- Health check endpoints
- Monitoring and logging setup
- Error tracking and reporting
- Performance monitoring

Next Session Priorities:
1. 🎯 IMMEDIATE: Polish remaining admin pages (emergency, rewards, settings)
2. 📱 MOBILE: Test and optimize mobile experience across all flows
3. 🧪 TESTING: Add basic unit tests for critical functions
4. 🚀 DEPLOY: Set up deployment configuration and CI/CD
