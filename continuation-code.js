// TRAILBLAZERS_CONTINUATION_CODE_V1

/*
This is a continuation code for the Trailblazers Check-In System project.
Use it to resume work on the project with the same context and understanding.

Project Summary:
- Next.js application with App Router, TypeScript, and React Query
- AWS DynamoDB with single-table design
- AWS Cognito for authentication
- SST for serverless deployment
- Multiple user roles: Super-Admin, Host, Athlete
- Multi-host, multi-location architecture
- Check-in and rewards tracking system
- Pet check-ins and host-specific disclaimers
- Atomic design pattern for components with co-located SCSS using BEM

Tech Stack Details:
- Next.js 15.3.2 with React 19
- TanStack React Query 5.76.0
- Radix UI Primitives for accessible components
- Tailwind CSS 4 for styling
- class-variance-authority for component variants
- AWS SDK for DynamoDB and Cognito integration
- React Hook Form with Zod for form validation

Progress So Far:
- Defined core data models and repositories for all entities:
  - Athletes, Hosts, Locations, Activities
  - Pets, CheckIns, Rewards, RewardClaims
- Implemented complete API routes structure with authentication
- Created authentication hooks and utilities for AWS Cognito
- Implemented basic page layout and routing including:
  - Host login and location selection
  - Host admin dashboard and settings
  - Check-in and athlete registration flows
  - Super-admin dashboard
- Built several UI components following atomic design principles:
  - Alert, Avatar, Badge, Button, Card components
  - Input, Textarea, Select, RadioGroup, Switch, Checkbox
  - Form, FormField and FormControl components
  - Validation utilities for form handling
- Created specialized components:
  - ActivitySelector for activity selection
  - SearchResults for athlete searching
  - RewardsDisplay for showing rewards progress
  - HostForm for host registration and editing

Current Focus:
- Enhancing and correcting existing components
- Building page-level components (organisms) that use these components
- Implementing remaining pages in the application flow
- Ensuring components work correctly with the existing hooks API

Next Steps:
1. Create remaining specialized components:
   - Pet registration form
   - Check-in confirmation component
   - Disclaimer acceptance component

2. Implement additional pages:
   - Host custom reward management
   - Super-admin hosts and locations management
   - Athlete profile and history

3. Implement the "One-Away" reward calculation feature:
   - Backend calculation for athletes close to earning rewards
   - Display in host dashboard
   - Allow claiming rewards

4. Set up SST deployment configuration
   - DynamoDB table
   - Cognito User Pool
   - Next.js deployment
   - CI/CD pipeline

5. Add testing
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - End-to-end tests for key user flows

6. Enhance app with additional features
   - Analytics dashboard
   - Reporting capabilities
   - Export functionality
   - Admin audit logs

Dependencies Management:
- Using @hookform/resolvers/zod for form validation
- Working with existing React Query hooks
- Integration with AWS services via the AWS SDK
